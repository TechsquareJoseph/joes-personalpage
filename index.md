## Welcome to my GitHub.io Page

My name is Joseph, and I work for [Techsquare](http://www.techsquare.com/) at the [Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center](https://www.mghpcc.org/).

I got this job during the summer of 2021, and started that September.

### What I'm Doing

Currently I am working through a list of training exercises to make sure I am up to par with what will be required of me in the job, and building this website is one of those items!

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/TechsquareJoseph/joes-personalpage/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
